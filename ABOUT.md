#### Language pickup choice and why?
Used PHP, it's very easy and can fit such small task.

#### What has been accomplished so far?
Consumption of the Hotel deals API in a way to show the deals over all the world.

#### Process?
- Checking the existing business that expedia provides in order to provide somehow similar experience
- Analyze the available rest API to understand the output.
- Review the allowed query parameters to understand which param should be used for specific need and I do extra check on the params part to discover more params the API can support.
- Sturcure of the api consumption allowing for later featuring, for instance adding other deals (cars, flights ...etc)
- Review Expedia site to understand how the data mapped and connected to each other so I can represent it correctly.

#### What you learned in the process. Mention how much (or little) experience you have with the particular language and framework you chose ?
- Orientation about Expedia business.
- How to check ready rest API without full documentaion and try to find out the allowed params for the API to get data as expected.
- Learn Heroku and trying to use Travis-CI.

### Experience
- I have more than 10 years of experience in PHP.
